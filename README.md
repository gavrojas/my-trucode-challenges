# 🚀 Trucode Bootcamp Challenges

This repository contains all the challenges completed during the **Trucode Bootcamp**, where we built hands-on projects focused on **backend development with Golang**, **frontend with Vue + TypeScript**, and **containerization using Docker**.

## 🧱 Main Technologies

- ⚙️ **Golang** – RESTful API development and backend logic
- 🖼️ **Vue 3 + TypeScript** – Modern UI with strong typing and reusable components
- 🐳 **Docker** – Application containerization for easier deployment
- 🌐 **REST API** – Communication between frontend and backend
