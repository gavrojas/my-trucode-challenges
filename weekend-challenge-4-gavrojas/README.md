# Algorithms collection

Look at the algorithms package, complete as many exercises as you can.
The order in the package is the suggested one by the complexity of the
problems but feel free to tackle them in the order of your preference.

As a recommendation, if you get stuck with one problem, move on to the next
one and come back to the problematic one after you solved another.

Remember that the purpose is to complete as many challenges as possible, so
the order you take on solving them is not as important.

> The first one is not specifically a executable script, but your understanding about how we can handle that scenario and how it could be reflected in our code. Please use just the knowledge we have discussed in class

If you want to run review if your algorithms pass the required tests just type in the terminal `go test ./...` instead of `go run .`
